## Attending

Anyone interested in the Julia programming language, regardless of experience. 

## Claudia Solis-Lemus

I am a fifth year graduate student in Statistics working with Cecile Ane in a
statistical inference method to reconstruct phylogenetic networks.

## Julia

I've been coding in Julia for a year now developing a package that will
implement my research methodology. The talk will cover a brief introduction to
my research project, my experience with Julia, the motivation for using it (as
opposed to other languages), and some online resources to learn more about
Julia.
